			<h3>How do applications work?</h3>
			<p>You can register by clicking the link at the top of this page; the deadline for applying is <b>April 30th</b>. Once all applications are in, we apply the following process to select candidates: the first 35 computer scientist and 15 mathematician applicants who are members of the study association W.I.S.V. 'Christiaan Huygens' are accepted automatically; we'll select the other 50 hackers based on skills and experience. We’ll then get in touch to let you know whether you’ve been invited to attend.</p>

			<h3>How does judging work?</h3>
			<p>Once you’ve finished your project, there’ll be an expo. The judges will walk around, and you’ll have a short (think two-three minute) window to pitch to them. Based on these pitches, the judges will pick a few teams to pitch on the finalists stage. There, you’ll again give a short pitch and answer some questions. Finally the judges will retire and announce the case-specific winners and grand prize winner.</p>
